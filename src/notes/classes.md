# classes

Classes are nothing but a collection of variables and member functions which are also called methods.

Memory-wise the layout is the same as that of a C struct. Only the variables are stored in the class unless it has virtual member functions or inheritance.

## Access specifiers

A class has access specifiers such as public, private and protected.
