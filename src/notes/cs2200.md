## Strings and Sets

> _Decision problem_ is a function that has a one bit output: true or false,
> 1 or 0.

To completely specify a decision problem, specify a set of possible inputs, and
the subset for which the output is true.

Encoding the input of a decision problem as a fixed finite length string is
possible over some fixed finite alphabet.

> A **finite alphabet** is any finite set. A finite length string is a
> sequence of the elements.

Set ops for two sets:

- Union
- Intersection
- Complement over set of all strings: Basically, it depends on the **set of
  all strings** that is chosen and hence this is often written as
  $\Sigma^* — A$ to emphasize this.
- Concatenation of two sets: $AB = \{xy | x \in A; y \in B\}$.

Set ops on one set:

- _asterate_ A<sup>\*</sup> of a set. $A^* = \bigcup_{n\geq 0}A^n$
- A<sup>+</sup> of a set. $A^+ = \bigcup_{n \geq 1}A^n$.

## States and transitions

A **state** of a system gives all the relevant information of a system, like a
_snapshot_. **Transitions** are changes of states.

If both are finite, then the system is called a
_finite state transition_ system. We model them using _finite automata_.

### Deterministic Finite Automata

Formally,

$$M = \left(Q,\Sigma,\delta,s,F\right)$$

- _Q_ is the finite set of states.
- $\Sigma$ is the finite set of the input _alphabet_.
- $\delta$ is the transition function that takes the current state and the
  input _character_ as the inputs and gives the next state as the output.
- _s_ is the start state.
- _F_ is the finite subset of _Q_ that are acceptable as the final states.

To extend the character input to a _string_, we define $\hat{\delta}$
inductively as follows:

- $\hat{\delta}\left(q, xa\right) = \delta\left(\hat{\delta}\left(q, x\right),
  a\right)$
- $\hat{\delta}\left(q, \epsilon\right) = q$

Where $x$ is a _string_, $a$ is a character, and $\epsilon$ is the empty input.

These can also be translated to the finite state machines
[discussed here](./csd.html#finite-state-machines).

A string $x$ is accepted by an automation $M$ if

$$\hat{\delta}\left(s,x\right) \in F$$

A _set_ or a _language_ accepted by $M$ is the set of all strings
accepted by some automata $M$, also called $L(M)$. Any subset of $\Sigma^*$
is said to be regular if it is accepted by some automaton $M$.

**Any** _finite_ subset of $\Sigma^*$ is regular (brute-force all strings).

> Proof that union of two regular languages is regular:

Let DFA 1 be $\left(Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, s_1, F_1\right)$ and DFA 2 be
$\left(Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, s_2, F_2\right)$

The final automata has the cartesian product of the two sets of states as the
set of states (Q), and the delta is also from Q1 x Q2 to Q1 x Q2. The set of
final states is $Q_1\times F_2 \cup Q_2 \times F_1$. Also,
$\hat{\delta}\left(\left(s_1, s_2\right), w\right) =
\left(\hat{\delta}\left(s_1, w\right),\hat{\delta}\left(s_2, w\right)\right)$

> Proof the the complement of a regular language is also regular:

All accepted final states become non-accepted, while all non-accepted final
states become accepted.

> Proof that the intersection of two regular languages is also regular:

Using set properties (De Morgan's Law), or instead follow the proof of
union and replace the final set with $F_1 \times F_2$.

### Non-deterministic Finite Automata

A finite automata where the next state is not necessarily determined by the
current state, and the input symbol. It is effectively in a
state of _guessing_.

To show that an automata accepts a set $B$, we argue that there exists a
lucky sequence of guesses that lead from the start state to an accept state
when the end of $x\in B$ is reached, but for any string outside the set,
it is impossible.

Formally,

$$M = \left(Q,\Sigma,\Delta,S,F\right)$$

- _Q_ is the finite set of states.
- $\Sigma$ is the finite set of the input _alphabet_.
- $\Delta$ is the transition function that takes the current state and the
  input _character_ as the inputs and gives the next state as the output.
  In this case, there are $2^Q$ possible outputs, instead of the
  $Q$ possible outputs in case of DFA. Each output corresponds to a unique
  element in the power set of $Q$.
- _S_ is the subset of acceptable states called the start states.
- _F_ is the finite subset of _Q_ that are acceptable as the final states.

To define the acceptance, we use the following rules:

$$\hat{\Delta}\left(A,\epsilon\right) = A$$

$$\hat{\Delta}\left(A, xa\right) = \bigcup_{q\in \hat{\Delta}\left(A,x\right)} 
\Delta\left(q,a\right)$$

Instead of the usual one state, we have the input to be a subset of the
possible state for $\hat{\Delta}$.

Acceptance happens when $x \in \Sigma^*$ satisfies $\hat{\Delta}
\left(S,x\right) \cap F \neq \phi$

Proof for Deterministic and Non-deterministic Finite Automata being equivalent:

- First we prove that $\hat{\Delta}\left(A, xy\right) =
  \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A, x\right), y\right)$

Induction on |y|:

For |y| = 0, it is trivially true from the above equations.

Assume for |y| ≤ n,

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\Delta}\left(A, xya\right) &= \bigcup_{q\in \hat{\Delta}\left(A,xy\right)} 
\Delta\left(q,a\right) \\
& = \bigcup_{q\in \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A,x\right),y\right)} 
\Delta\left(q,a\right) \\
& = \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A,x\right),ya\right)
\end{align*}
$$

- Second, the function $\hat{\Delta}$ commutes with the set union, i.e.,
  $\hat{\Delta}(\bigcup_i A_i,x) = \bigcup_i \hat{\Delta}(A_i, x)$

Induction on |x|:

For |x| = 0, it is trivially true.

Assume for |x| ≤ n.

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\Delta}\left(\bigcup_i A_i, xa\right) & = 
\hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(\bigcup_i A_i,x\right),a\right) \\ & = 
\hat{\Delta}\left(\bigcup_i\hat{\Delta}\left(A_i, x\right),a\right) \\ & = 
\bigcup_i \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A_i , x\right), a\right) \\ & = 
\bigcup_i\hat{\Delta}\left(A_i, xa\right)
\end{align*}
$$

Now the following two automata can be shown to accept the same set.

$$\left(Q, \Sigma, \Delta, S, F\right) = \left(2^Q, \Sigma, \hat{\Delta}, S, 
\{ A | A \subseteq Q, A \cap F ≠ \phi\} \right)$$

To create a minimal DFA from an NFA, check the decision tree for the NFA and
do a BFS, stopping when you don't get any new states.

#### $\epsilon$ transition

This has an $\epsilon$ slip that allows the state to transition without
reading any input symbol.

> Proof that $\epsilon$ transition NFA's have an equivalent NFA with just one
> start state and no $\epsilon$ transitions.

**Defn:** $\epsilon$ closure: The set of all states that a state can reach on
an $\epsilon$ transition.

Define a new transition function such that the states attained by the state
with $\epsilon$ transitions further take one symbol.

For an $\epsilon$ NFA to be converted to a regular NFA, we define

$$\begin{align*}
\Delta'\left(q,\sigma\right) = \bigcup_{q'\in \epsilon(q)}
\Delta\left(q', \sigma\right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\epsilon(q)$ is the $\epsilon$ closure of q.

The final states

$$
F' = \{q | \epsilon(q)\cap F \neq \phi\}
$$

Everything else remains the same.

## Pattern Matching

- $a$ for each $a \in \Sigma$, matched by $a$ only.
- $\epsilon$, matched by the empty string.
- $\phi$, matched by nothing.
- $#$, matched by any symbol in $\Sigma$.
- $@$, matched by anything in $\Sigma^*$.

### Combining patterns

- $x$ matches $\alpha + \beta$ if $x$ matches either of those.
- $x$ matches $\alpha\cap\beta$ if $x$ matches both of them.
- $x$ matches $\alpha\beta$ if $x$ matches $\alpha$ followed by $\beta$.
- $x$ matches $~\alpha$ if it doesn't match $\alpha$.
- $x$ matches $\alpha^*$ and $\alpha^+$ the same way as regex.

NOTE:<br>
$\left(0 + 1\right)^* $ accepts 010101<br>
$ 0^* + 1^* $ accepts 000000 or 111111 but only strings of one symbol

For any pattern $R$, we define $L(R)$ to be the language that matches the
pattern $R$.

Any regular language can have countably infinite representations in form of
patterns.

**Theorem**: If $R$ is a regular expression, then $L(R)$ is regular.

Proof: Check for each possible case and all of them can be decomposed into a
combination of the above situations.

> It is always possible to remove the complement in a regular expression.

### DFAs to Regex

- State elimination
  - Keep remaining states
  - Replace transitions with transitions labelled as regex.
  - while true

## Class

**Theorem:** Set of all C Programs is countable.

Proof: <br>

Represent the ascii source code in binary. Then it will be a subset of
$\{0,1\}^*$ and that is bijective with the natural numbers
($n(b) + 2^{|b|} -1$). It is also obviously infinite.

> Hilbert's Entscheidungs Problem: Given a mathematical statement, is
> it derivable from the axioms?

**Defn:** A language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a subset of $\Sigma^*$.

**Theorem:** The cardinality of all the languages over some alphabet is
uncountably infinite, i.e., $\left|\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\right| >
\left|\mathbb{N}\right|$.

Proof:

Cantor's argument:

Set of all languages = $\mathcal{P}\left(\{0,1\}^*\right)$

| input         | $\epsilon$ | 0   | 1   | 00  |
| ------------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| f($\epsilon$) | 1          | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| f(0)          | 1          | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| f(1)          | 0          | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| f(01)         | 1          | 1   | 0   | 1   |

The entries in the table tell whether that particular element is present in the
subset is gotten from the result or not.

Take the diagonal and bit flip all bits. It will differ from all the strings in
the table by atleast one bit.

[Deterministic Finite Automata](./cs2200.html#deterministic-finite-automata)
along with a few examples of languages based on the problem.

### Limits of DFAs

- DFAs have finite memory.
- They can also only read one symbol at a time from left to right.

For instance, there is no way of constructing a DFA that can accept $L =
\{0^n1^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

Similarly, there is no DFA that can accept the language $L = \{0^{2^n}| n
\in \mathbb{N}\}$

> Important Proof

If $L$ is regular, where $L = \{ww | w \in \Sigma^* \}$, then $\sqrt{L}$ is
also regular.

Proof:

Let the DFA be $\left(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\right)$. We define the
NFA as follows:

$$N = \left(Q \times Q \times Q, \Sigma, \Delta, A, f\right)$$

where

$$\begin{align}
A &= \bigcup_{i\in Q} {\left(i, q_0, i\right)}
\\
f &= \bigcup_{i \in Q\atop z\in F} {\left(i, i, z\right)}
\\
\Delta\left(\left(i, \alpha, \beta\right), a_0\right) &= \left(i, 
\delta\left(\alpha, a_0\right), \delta\left(\beta, a_0\right)\right)
\end{align}$$

### Pumping Lemma

Let $L$ be a regular language. $\exists k > 0$, s.t. $\forall x,y,z$ s.t.
$xyz \in L$ and $|y| > k$, $\exists u,v,w$ s.t. $y = uvw, v\ne \epsilon$
s.t. $\forall i \geq 0, xuv^iwz \in L$.

Proof: $\exists M = \left(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\right)$ s.t.
$L\left(M\right) = L$.

Set $k = |Q|$

Let $x,y,z \in \Sigma^*$ s.t. $|y| > k$ & $xyz \in L$

$$\begin{align*}
\hat{\delta}\left(q_0, x\right) &= q &
\hat{\delta}\left(q, y\right) &= q' &
\hat{\delta}\left(q', z\right) & \in F &
\end{align*}$$

$y = y_1y_2...y_r, r> k$. We define $q_i = \hat{\delta}
\left(q, y_1y_2...y_i\right)$

Consider the sequence $q_1q_2q_3...q_r$

$\implies \exists s, t$ s.t. $q_s = q_t$ in the sequence (by PHP).

Define

$$u = y_1y_2...y_s$$

$$v = y_{s+1}y_{s+2}...y_t$$

$$w = y_{t+1}y_{t+2}...y_r$$

$$\begin{align}
\hat{\delta}\left(q_0, x\right)  &= q 
\\
\hat{\delta}\left(q, u\right)  &= q_s 
\\
\hat{\delta}\left(q_s, v\right)  &= q_s \implies \hat{\delta}
\left(q_s, v^i\right) = q_s 
\\
\hat{\delta}\left(q_s, wz\right)  &\in F
\end{align}$$

An analogy with a 2 player game:

Prover: I'll give you a number k

Spoiler: I'll find x, y, z such that the concatenation is in the language with
length of y > k

Prover: I'll split y into u, v, w where v is non-empty.

Spoiler: I'll find an i > 0 such that the pumping lemma string doesn't belong
in the DFA. If I do that, I'll win. And L will not be regular.

### An alternate way to prove that a language is not regular.

Suppose you take a DFA for the language. We take an infinite set of strings
such that all of them go to a different state. Then it's obvious that the
DFA cannot be finite and hence, it is not a DFA.

Example:

$$\begin{align}
L &= \{0^n1^n | n \ge 0\}
\\
M &= \left(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\right)
\\
L &= L\left(M\right)
\\
W &= \{0^i | i \ge 0\}
\end{align}$$

We claim that any two strings in $W$ reach a different state.

**Proof:**

$$\begin{align}
\hat{\delta}\left(q_0, 0^i\right) &\ne \hat{\delta}\left(q_0, 0^j\right) 
\forall i \ne j
\\
\hat{\delta}\left(q_0, 0^i1^i\right) &= \hat{\delta}\left(\hat{\delta}
\left(q_0, 0 ^i\right), 1^i\right) 
\\
&\ne \hat{\delta}\left(\hat{\delta}\left(q_0, 0^j\right), 1^i\right)
\end{align}$$

If this wasn't true then both the strings will be accepted, which is
impossible according to the language.

### Distinguishability

**Defn**: Let $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ be a language. Two strings $x,y \in
\Sigma^*$ are said to be distinguishable by $L$ if $\exists z \in
\Sigma^*$ s.t. $xz \in L$ and $yz \notin L$.

**Defn**: A set $S$ is distinguishable if $\forall i \ne j \in S$ and $i$
and $j$ are distinguishable.

**Theorem**: Let $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ be a regular language and $S$ be
a distinguishable set. For any DFA accepting $L$, $\left|Q\right| \ge
\left|S\right|$.

### Myhill-Nerode Relations

An equivalence relation $\equiv$ over a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is
said to be a *Myhill-Nerode relation* if

1. $\equiv$ is a right congruence, i.e., if $x \equiv y$, then $x\sigma
   \equiv y\sigma \forall \sigma \in \Sigma$.
1. $\equiv$ is a refinement of $L$, i.e., if $x\equiv y$ then $x\in L
   \iff y\in L$.
1. $\equiv$ is of finite index.

If $L$ is regular and $M = \left(Q,\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\right)$
accepts M, then $\equiv_M$ is a *Myhill-Nerode* relation.
It is trivial to see why this is the case.

We define $\equiv_M$ to be the equivalence relation gotten when any two
strings end up in the same equivalence class in the language accepted by
$M$ i.e. $\hat{\delta}\left(q_0, x\right) = \hat{\delta}\left(q_0, y\right)$.

We define $\equiv_L$ to be the equivalence relation gotten when any two
strings $x$ and $y$ s.t. $\forall z \in \Sigma^*, xz \in L
\Longleftrightarrow yz \in L$.

**Theorem**: Let $\equiv$ be an MH relation over $L$.

Then $\equiv \subseteq \equiv_L$.

Proof:

$$\begin{align}
&\forall x,y, x\equiv y 
\\
&\forall \sigma \in \Sigma, x\sigma \equiv y\sigma 
\\
&\forall z \in \Sigma^* , \implies \left(xz \in L \iff yz\in L\right)
\\
&\implies x\equiv_L y
\end{align}$$

### Minimizing DFAs and Isomorphism

Let $M = \left(Q,\Sigma, \delta, s, F\right)$ and $M' = \left(Q', \Sigma,
\delta', s', F' \right)$

Let $f: Q\rightarrow Q'$ be a bijection such that the following hold:

1. $s' = f(s)$
1. $q\in F \Longleftrightarrow f(q) \in F'$
1. $f(\delta(q,\sigma)) = \delta'(f(q), \sigma) \forall q \in Q, \sigma \in
   \Sigma$

**Theorem**: If $M$ and $M'$ are two minimal automatas then they are isomorphic.

Proof:

We define the function $f^{-1}: Q' \rightarrow Q$ to be $\hat{\delta}(s, x)$

**Algorithm** to minimize the DFA:

States $q, q' \in M$ are equivalent if $\forall x\in \Sigma^*, \hat{\delta}
(q,x) \in F \Longleftrightarrow \hat{\delta}(q', x) \in F$

This is clearly an equivalence relation for the states.

Show that the Myhill-Nerode relation of the **Quotient Automata**
$M_{/\approx}$ is a superset of the other. Hence the quotient automata is the
minimal one.

*Algorithm*:

Mark any two pairs of states that are clearly not equivalent (one of them is a
final state, other is not).

Repeat until no new pairs are marked

If $\exists \{p,q\}$ s.t. for some $\sigma \in \Sigma$, $\{\delta(p,\sigma),
\delta(q,\sigma)\}$ are marked then mark $\{p,q\}$

### Context free languages

Productions: A kind of statement that telly you substitution rule.

Non-terminal strings are strings that can be replaced using productions.

Terminals are ones that can't be further replaced.

Therefore, CFG is a 4 tuple that is defined using
$\left(N, \Sigma, P, S\right)$

- $N$ is the set of non-terminals (RHS in any production).
- $\Sigma$ set of terminals
- $P$ set of production girls
- $S$ start symbol

E.g. $L = \{0^n1^n| n \ge 0\}$

$S \rightarrow 0S1 | \epsilon$

- A string $\beta \in (N \bigcup \Sigma^* )$ is *derivable* from $\alpha \in
  (N\bigcup \Sigma)^* $ if there is a production rule to substitute a
  non-terminal in $\alpha$ and get $\beta$.
- A string in $(N\bigcup\Sigma)^*$ is known as a *sentential form* if it is
  derivable from S.
- A string in $\Sigma^*$ is a **sentence** if it is derivable from $S$.

Example: Dyck language (balanced parentheses)

\[\[\]\[\[\]\]\[\[\]\]\] is in L but \[\]\] is not

$S \rightarrow [S] | SS | \epsilon$

**Theorem:** For a regular language $L$, there exists grammar $G$ s.t.
$L = L(G)$

Construction:

$$\begin{align}
\exists M = \left(Q,\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\right) \\
L(M) = L \\
N = \{S_i | q_i \in Q\} \\
S_i \rightarrow \sigma S_j \forall \delta(q_i, \sigma) = q_j \\
q_i \in F \implies S_i \rightarrow \epsilon \\
\end{align}$$

Further proof:

1. $L(M) \subseteq L(G)$

if $\hat{\delta}\left(q_i, w\right) = q_j$ then $S_i$ goes to $wS_j$

Base case: $\hat{\delta}(q_i, \epsilon) = q_0$ then $S_i \rightarrow S_i$

$\hat{\delta}(q_i, \sigma) = q_j$ then $\exists$ productions $S_i \rightarrow \sigma S_j$

2. $L(G) \subseteq L(M)$

induct on the length of the derivation

#### Ambiguous CFGs

These are those for which there are more than one parse trees. It is ambiguous
if it has more than one leftmost derivation. Use multiple rules to resolve
amiguousness.

However some languages are inherently ambiguous.

$a^ib^jc^kd^l | i = j \land k = l \lor i = l \land j = k$

basically no possible grammar can make it unambiguous.

#### Closure properties

Closed under union, concatenation, kleene closure.

**NOT CLOSED** under intersection and complementation.

#### Chomsky Normal form

A CFG G is in CNF if every production is of the form $A\rightarrow BC$ or
$A\rightarrow \sigma$

CNF grammars do not generate $\epsilon$

- Remove $A\rightarrow \epsilon$

  - For every production $B\rightarrow \alpha A\beta$, add
    $B\rightarrow \alpha\beta$

- Remove $A\rightarrow B$

  - $B\rightarrow \beta$ with $A\rightarrow \beta$

First remove all the $\epsilon$ productions as they give more unit productions.

Then remove all unit productions.

This gives the minimum size grammar in CNF.
