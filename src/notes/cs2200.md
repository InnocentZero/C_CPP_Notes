Types of grammar:

1. Right linear
1. Context free
1. unrestricted

Types of machine models:

1. finite memory: finite automata, regex
1. finite memory with stack: pushdown automata
1. unrestricted: turing machines, post systems, λ calculus etc.

There is a one to one correspondence for the numberings above.

## Strings and Sets

> *Decision problem* is a function that has a one bit output: true or false, 1 or 0.

To completely specify a decision problem, specify a set of possible inputs and the subset for which the output is true.

Encoding the input of a decision problem as a fixed finite length string is possible over some fixed finite alphabet.

> A **finite alphabet** is any finite set. A finite length string is a sequence of the elements.

Set ops for two sets:

- Union
- Intersection
- Complement over set of all strings: Basically, it depends on the **set of all strings** that is chosen and hence this is often written as $\Sigma^* - A$ to emphasize this.
- Concatenation of two sets: $AB = \{xy | x \in A; y \in B\}$.

Set ops on one set:

- *asterate* A\* of a set. $A^* = \bigcup_{n\geq 0}A^n$
- A<sup>+</sup> of a set. $A^+ = \bigcup_{n \geq 1}A^n$.

## States and transitions

A **state** of a system gives all the relevant information of a system, like a *snapshot*. **Transitions** are changes of states.

If both are finite, then the system is called a *finite state transition* system. We model them using *finite automata*.

### Deterministic Finite Automata

Formally,

$$M = \left(Q,\Sigma,\delta,s,F\right)$$

- *Q* is the finite set of states.
- $\Sigma$ is the finite set of the input *alphabet*.
- $\delta$ is the transition function that takes the current state and the input *character* as the inputs and gives the next state as the output.
- *s* is the start state.
- *F* is the finite subset of *Q* that are acceptable as the final states.

To extend the character input to a *string*, we define $\hat{\delta}$ inductively as follows:

- $\hat{\delta}\left(q, xa\right) = \delta\left(\hat{\delta}\left(q, x\right), a\right)$
- $\hat{\delta}\left(q, \epsilon\right) = q$

Where $x$ is a *string*, $a$ is a character, and $\epsilon$ is the empty input.

These can also be translated to the finite state machines [discussed here](./csd.html#finite-state-machines).

A string $x$ is accepted by an automation $M$ if

$$\hat{\delta}\left(s,x\right) \in F$$

A *set* or a *language* accepted by $M$ is the set of all strings accepted by some automata $M$, also called $L(M)$. Any subset of $\Sigma^*$ is said to be regular if it is accepted by some automaton $M$.

### Non-deterministic Finite Automata

A finite automata where the next state is not necessarily determined by the current state and the input symbol. It is effectively in a state of *guesssing*.

To show that an automata accepts a set $B$, we argue that there exists a lucky sequence of guesses that lead from the start state to an accept state when the end of $x\in B$ is reached, but for any string outside of the set, it is impossible.

Formally,

$$M = \left(Q,\Sigma,\Delta,S,F\right)$$

- *Q* is the finite set of states.
- $\Sigma$ is the finite set of the input *alphabet*.
- $\Delta$ is the transition function that takes the current state and the input *character* as the inputs and gives the next state as the output. In this case, there are $2^Q$ possible outputs, instead of the $Q$ possible outputs in case of DFA. Each output corresponds to a unique element in the power set of $Q$.
- *S* is the subset of acceptable states called the start states.
- *F* is the finite subset of *Q* that are acceptable as the final states.

To define the acceptance, we use the following rules:

$$\hat{\Delta}\left(A,\epsilon\right) = A$$

$$\hat{\Delta}\left(A, xa\right) = \bigcup_{q\in \hat{\Delta}\left(A,x\right)} \Delta\left(q,a\right)$$

Instead of the usual one state, we have the input to be a subset of the possible state for $\hat{\Delta}$.

Acceptance happens when $x \in \Sigma^*$ satisfies $\hat{\Delta} \left(S,x\right) \cap F \neq \phi$

Proof for Deterministic and Non-deterministic Finite Automata being equivalent:

- First we prove that $\hat{\Delta}\left(A, xy\right) = \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A, x\right), y\right)$

Induction on |y|:

For |y| = 0, it is trivially true from the above equations.

Assume for |y| ≤ n,

$$\begin{align*}
\hat{\Delta}\left(A, xya\right) &= \bigcup_{q\in \hat{\Delta}\left(A,xy\right)} \Delta\left(q,a\right) \\
& = \bigcup_{q\in \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A,x\right),y\right)} \Delta\left(q,a\right) \\
& = \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A,x\right),ya\right)
\end{align*}$$

- Second, the function $\hat{\Delta}$ commutes with the set union, i.e., $\hat{\Delta}(\bigcup_i A_i,x) = \bigcup_i \hat{\Delta}(A_i, x)$

Induction on |x|:

For |x| = 0, it is trivially true.

Assume for |x| ≤ n.

$$\begin{align*}
\hat{\Delta}\left(\bigcup_i A_i, xa\right) & = \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(\bigcup_i A_i,x\right),a\right) \\ & = \hat{\Delta}\left(\bigcup_i\hat{\Delta}\left(A_i, x\right),a\right) \\ & = \bigcup_i \hat{\Delta}\left(\hat{\Delta}\left(A_i , x\right), a\right) \\ & = \bigcup_i\hat{\Delta}\left(A_i, xa\right)
\end{align*}$$

Now the following two automata can be shown to accept the same set.

$$\left(Q, \Sigma, \Delta, S, F\right) = \left(2^Q, \Sigma, \hat{\Delta}, S, \{ A | A \subseteq Q, A \cap F ≠ \phi\} \right)$$

## Pattern Matching

- $a$ for each $a \in \Sigma$, matched by $a$ only.
- $\epsilon$, matched by the empty string.
- $\phi$, matched by nothing.
- $#$, matched by any symbol in $\Sigma$.
- $@$, matched by anything in $\Sigma^*$.

### Combining patterns

- $x$ matches $\alpha + \beta$ if $x$ matches either of those.
- $x$ matches $\alpha\cap\beta$ if $x$ matches both of them.
- $x$ matches $\alpha\beta$ if $x$ matches $\alpha$ followed by $\beta$.
- $x$ matches $~\alpha$ if it doesn't match $\alpha$.
- $x$ matches $\alpha^*$ and $\alpha^+$ the same way as regex.

## Class

**Theorem:** Set of all C Programs is countable.

Proof: <br>

Represent the ascii source code in binary. Then it will be a subset of $\{0,1\}^*$ and that is bijective with the natural numbers ($n(b) + 2^{|b|} -1$). It is also obviously infinite.

> Hilbert's Entscheidungs Problem: Given a mathematical statement, is it derivable from the axioms.

**Defn:** A language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a subset of $\Sigma^*$.

**Theorem:** The cardinality of all the languages over some alphabet is uncountably infinite, i.e., $\left|\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\right| > \left|\mathbb{N}\right|$.

Proof:

Cantor's argument:

Set of all languages = $\mathcal{P}\left(\{0,1\}^*\right)$

| input         | $\epsilon$ | 0   | 1   | 00  |
| ------------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
| f($\epsilon$) | 1          | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| f(0)          | 1          | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| f(1)          | 0          | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| f(01)         | 1          | 1   | 0   | 1   |

The entries in the table tell whether that particular element is present in the subset that is obtained from the result or not.

Take the diagonal and bit flip all bits. It will differ from all the strings in the table by atleast one bit.
