## Von Neumann Architecture

Fetches the memory into various kinds of buffers to speed up memory fetch by CPU.

### Caches

Each core has separate L1 cache for instructions and data. L2 cache is common for both and mostly per-core (can also be shared across multiple cores). L3 cache is shared across all the cores.

### Registers

Apart from this there are also registers next to the ALU to speed up computation. More can be slower or faster depending on the number. More means lesser loads and stores. More also means longer routes (more time for pulse to travel) and clock cycle logic to choose the register become slower.

### RAM memory

- Has capacitors.
- Capacitors discharge over time hence needs to be continuously powered and recharged.
- Take time to charge and discharge which creates bottlenecks for CPU.

## Instruction Set

Different Instructions: x86, ARM, RISC V, MIPS.

- Programs written for one processor cannot execute on another.
- Early trend: more instructions, complex instructions.
- RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computing
  - Instructions are small and simple
  - Software does not complicate operations.

## RISC V

Open source. Has 32 int and 32 FP registers. Also has XLEN variable which is either 32 or 64 for 32 bit and 64 bit processors respectively.

| Register | ABI Name |                   Description                    |

| x10-x11  |  a0-a1   |              Fn args/ return values              |
| x12-x18  |  a2-a7   |                     Fn args                      |
| x18-x27  |  s2-s11  |                 Saved registers                  |
| x27-x31  |  t3-t6   |                   Temporaries                    |

> Maximum memory depends on the size of the address bus from the load store unit to the memory.

### Instructions

- `add rd, rs1, rs2`: add the contents of rs1 and rs2 and store it in rd. Signed addition. Also has the unsigned version. Similarly, sub, and, or, xor also exist.

- `mul/mulh rd, rs1, rs2`: multiplies and stores the lower/upper 32 bits in rd.

- `div/rem rd, rs1, rs2`: stores the quotient/remainder.

- `sll rd, rs1, rs2`: Left shift the number in rs1 by the value in rs2 and store in rd.

- `srl rd, rs1, rs2`: Right shift the number in rs1 by the value in rs2 and store in rd. Zero extends.

- `sra rd, rs1, rs2`: Right shift the number in rs1 by the value in rs2 and store in rd. Sign extends.

All of these also have an immediate version where the last argument is a hardcoded literal.

- `l(b/h/w) rd, imm(rs1)`: loads a byte/half-word/word to rd(dest. register) from \*(rs1 + imm)

- `l(b/h/w)u rd, imm(rs1)`: loads a byte/half-word/word to rd(dest. register) from \*(rs1 + imm). This one zero-extends on the left.

- `s(b/h/w) rd, imm(rs1)`: stores a byte/half-word/word to \*(rs1 + imm) from the contents of rd.

- `j offset/label`: jump to the given label/offset

- `blt/bltu r1, r2, label/offset`: if r1 \< r2 (signed or unsigned), jump to label or symbol.

The above instructions have greater than, greater than equal to variants as well. Also immediate variants of all.

### Program Counter

This keeps track of the next instruction to be executed. Usually incremented by 4 unless branches.
