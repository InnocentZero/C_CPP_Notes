## Von Neumann Architecture

Fetches the memory into various kinds of buffers to speed up memory fetch by CPU.

### Caches

Each core has separate L1 cache for instructions and data. L2 cache is common for both and mostly per-core (can also be shared across multiple cores). L3 cache is shared across all the cores.

### Registers

Apart from this there are also registers next to the ALU to speed up computation. More can be slower or faster depending on the number. More means lesser loads and stores. More also means longer routes (more time for pulse to travel) and clock cycle logic to choose the register become slower.

### RAM memory

- Has capacitors.
- Capacitors discharge over time hence needs to be continuously powered and recharged.
- Take time to charge and discharge which creates bottlenecks for CPU.

## Instruction Set

Different Instructions: x86, ARM, RISC V, MIPS.

- Programs written for one processor cannot execute on another.
- Early trend: more instructions, complex instructions.
- RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computing
  - Instructions are small and simple
  - Software does not complicate operations.

### RISC V

Open source. Has 32 registers. Also has XLEN variable which is either 32 or 64 for 32 bit and 64 bit processors respectively.

- x0: First register. Hard-wired to 0.
