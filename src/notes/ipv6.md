# ipv6

- Welp, [ipv4](ipv4.md) got over. So we needed more addresses.
- 128 bits. Much larger than 32 bits of ipv4.

## Multicasting

- Unlike [ipv4](ipv4.md), this doesn't have a generic broadcast address for a subnet.
- Just as IPv4 has _255.255.255.255_ as the global subnet broadcast address, here the equivalent is _ff02::1_.
- It is also possible to have a global multicast.
- The first 64 bits are global address space (smallest subnet size).
