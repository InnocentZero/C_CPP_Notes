# python

## Simple Operations

Python has the capability of carrying out calculations. Enter a
calculation directly into a print statement:

```py
print(2 + 2)
print(5 + 4 -3)
```

> The spaces around the plus and the minus signs here are **optional**
> (the code would work without them) but they make it easier to read.

Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an **asterisk
\*** to indicate multiplication and a **forward slash /** to indicate
division.

Use **parentheses** to determine which operations are performed first.


```py
print(2*(3+4))
print(10/2)
```


> Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or
> ***float***, as it is called in programming). We'll learn more about
> **floats** later.

Dividing by zero produces an **error** in python, as no answer can be
calculated.


```py
 print(11/0)

 Traceback(most recent call last):
  File"\<stdin\>", line 1, in \<module\>
 ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```


> In python, the last line of an error message indicates the error's
> type. Read error messages carefully, as they often tell you how to fix
> a program!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Floats

**Floats** are used in python to represent numbers that **aren't
integers** (whole numbers). Some examples of numbers that are
represented as floats are 0.5 and -7.8538953. They can be created
directly by entering a number with a decimal point, or by using
operations such as division on integers.


```py
print(3/4)
```


> Computers can't store floats perfectly accurately, in the same way we
> can't write down the complete decimal expansion of 1/3
> (0.333333333...). Keep this in mind, because it often leads to
> infuriating bugs!

A float is also produced by running an operation on two floats, or on a
float and an integer.

> A float can be added to an integer, because Python silently converts
> the ineger to a float.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exponentiation

Besides addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, Python also
supports exponentiation, which is raising of one number to the power of
another. This operation is performed using two asterisks.


```py
print(2**5)
print(9**(1/2))
```


> You can chain exponentiation together. In other words, you can raise a
> number to multiple powers. Eg. 2\*\*3\*\*2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Quotient

**Floor division** is done using two forward slashes and is used to
determine the **quotient** of a division (the quantity produced by the
division of two numbers).

**For example:**


```py
print(20//6)
```


The code above will output 3. \>You can also use floor division on
floats

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Remainder

The **modulo operator** is carried out with a percent symbol (%) and is
used to get the **remainder** of a division.

**For example:**


```py
print(20%6)
print(1.25%0.5)
```


> All numerical operators can also be used with floats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strings

If you want to use text in python, you have to use a *string*. A
*string* is created by entering text between **two single or double
quotation marks.**


```py
print("Python is fun!")
print("Always look on the bright side")
```


> The delimiter (" or ') used for a string doesn't affect how it behaves
> in any way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Backslash

Some characters cant be directly included in a *string*. For instance,
double quotes can't be directly included in a double quote *string*;
this would cause it to end prematurely.

Characters like double quotes must be escaped by placing a **backslash**
before them. Double quotes need to be escaped in double quotes strings
only, and the same is true for single quotes strings. **For Example:**


```py
print('Brian\'s mother: He\'s not an angel. He\'s a naughty boy!')
```


> Backslashes can also be used to escape tabs, arbitrary Unicode
> characters, and various other things that can't be reliably printed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Newlines

\*\*\* represents a new line. It can be used in strings to create
multi-line output.


```py
print('One **\n** Two **\n** Three')
```


Newlines will automatically be added for strings that are created using
three quotes.


```py
print("""This
is a
multiline
text""")
```


> Similarly, \*\* represents a tab.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Concatenation

As with integers and floats, strings in Python can be added, using a
process called *concatenation*, which can be done on any two strings.


```py
print("Spam" + 'eggs')
```


> When concatenating strings, it doesn't matter whether they have been
> created with single or double quotes, as seen above

> Adding a string to a number produces an error, as even though they
> might look similar, they are two different entities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### String Operations

Strings can also be **multiplied** with integers. This produces a
repeated version of that *string*. The order of the *string* and the
*integer* doesn't matter, but the *string* usually comes first.


```py
print("spam"*3)

print(4*'2')
```


> Strings can't be multiplied with other strings. Strings also can't be
> multiplied by floats, even if the floats are whole numbers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variables

A *variable* allows you to store a value by assigning it to a name,
which can be used to refer to the value later in the program. For
example, in game development, you would use a *variable* to to store the
points of the player.

To assign a *variable*, use **one equals sign**.


```py
user = "James"
```


You can use variables to perform corresponding operations, just as you
did with numbers and strings:


```py
x = 7
print(x)

print(x + 3)
print(x)
```


> The *variable* stores its value throughout the program.

Variables can be assigned as many times as you want, in order to change
their value. In python, variables don't have specific types, so you can
assign a *string* to a *variable*, and later assign an *integer* to the
same *variable*.


```py
x = 123.456
print(x)

x = "This is a string"
print(x+"!")
```


> However, this is not a good practice. To avoid mistakes, try to avoid
> overwriting the same *variable* with different data types.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Variable Names

Certain restrictions apply in regard to the characters that may be used
in python *variable* names. The only characters that are allowed are
**letters, numbers and underscore**. Also, they can't start with
numbers. Not following these rules results in errors.


```py
this_is_a_normal_name = 7

123abc = 7
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```


> Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, **lastname**
> and **Lastname** are two different *variable* names in python.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the **del** statement to remove a *variable*, which means
the reference from the name to the value is deleted, and trying to use
the *variable* causes an error.


```py
foo = 3
del foo
print(foo)
```


Deleted variables can also e reassigned to later as normal.


```py
foo = 2
bar = 3
del bar
bar = 8
print(foo + bar)
```


> The variables **foo** and **bar** are called **metasyntactic**
> variables, meaning they are used as placeholder names in example code
> to demonstrate something.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Input

To get input from the user in python, you can use the intuitively named
**input** *function*. For example, a game can ask for a user's name and
age as input and use them in the game.

The input *function* prompts the user for input, and returns what they
enter as a *string* (with the contents automatically escaped).


```py
x = input()
print(x)
```


> Even if the user enters a number as an input, it is processed as a
> **string**.

The **input** statement needs to be followed by parentheses. You can
provide a *string* to **input()** between the parentheses, producing a
prompt message.


```py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello"+name)
```


> The prompt message helps clarify what the input is asking for.

To convert the string to a number, we can use the **int()** *function*:


```py
age =int(input())
print(age)
```


Similarly, in order to convert a number to a *string*, the str()
*function* is used. This can be useful if you need to use a number in
*string concatenation*. **For example:**


```py
age = 42
print("His age is" + str(age))
```


> You can convert to float using the float() function.

You can take input multiple times to take multiple user input. **For
example:**


```py
name = input()
age = input()

print(name + "is" + age)
```


> When input function executes, program flow stops until the user enters
> some value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## In Place Operators

**In-place operators** allow you to write code like `x = x + 3` more
concisely as `x +=3` . The same thing is possible with other operators
such as **-,\*, /, and %** as well.


```py
x = 2
print(x)

x += 3
print(x)
```


These operators can be used on types other than numbers, as well, such
as **strings.**


```py
x= "spam"
print(x)

x += "eggs"
print(x)
```


> In-place operators can be used for any numerical operation
> (+,-,\*,/,%,\*\*,//).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Booleans

Another type in python is the *Boolean* type. There are two *Boolean*
values: **True** and **False**. They can be created by comparing values,
for instance by using the equal to ==.


```py
my_boolean = True
print(my_boolean)
True

print(2 == 3)
False

print("hello" == 'hello')
True
```


> *Be careful not to confuse **assignment** (one equal sign) with
> **comparison** (two equal signs).*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comparison

Another comparison operator, the **not equal** operator (!=), evaluates
to **True** if the items being compared aren't equal, and **False** if
they are.


```py
print(1 != 1)
False

print("eleven" != "seven")
True

print(2 != 10)
True
```


> *Comparison operators are also called **relational operators**.*

Python also has operators that determine whether one number (float or
integer) is greater than or smaller than another. These operators are \>
and \< respectively.


```py
print(7 > 5)
True

print(10 < 10)
False
```


> *Different numeric types can also be compared, for example, integer
> and float.*

The greater than or equal to, and the smaller than or equal to operators
are \>= and \<=. They are the same as the strict greater than and
smaller than operators, except that they return **True** when comparing
equal numbers.


```py
print(7<= 8)
True

print(9>=9.0)
True
```


Greater than and smaller than operators can also be used to compare
strings **lexicographically**. **For Example:**


```py
print("Annie" > "Andy")
True
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### If statements

You can use **if** statements to run code if a certain condition holds.
If the expression evaluates to **True**, some statements are carried
out.Otherwise they aren't carried out. An if statement looks like this:


```py
if expression:
    statements
```


> *Python uses **indentation**, (white spaces at the beginning of a
> line) to delimit blocks of code. Depending on the program's logic,
> indentation can be mandatory. As you can see, the statements in the
> **if** should be indented.*

Here is an example of **if** statement:


```py
if 10 > 5:
    print("10 is greater than 5")

print("The program ended")
```


The expression determines whether 10 is greater than 5. Since it is, the
indented statement runs, and "10 is greater than 5" is output. Then, the
unindented statement, which is not a part of the **if** statement, is
run, and "Program ended" is displayed.

> *Notice the **colon** at the end of the expression in the if
> statement.*

To perform more complex checks, **if** statements can be nested, one
inside the other. This means that the inner **if** statement is the
statement part of the outer one. This is one way to see whether multiple
conditions are satisfied.

**For example:**


```py
num = 12
if num > 5:
    print("Bigger than 5")
    if num <= 47:
        print("between 5 and 47")
```


> _**Indentation** is used to define the level of nesting._

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### else Statements

The **if** statement allows you to check a condition and run some
statements, if the condition is **True**. The **else** statement can be
used to run some statements when the condition of the **if** statement
is **False**.

As with **if** statements, the code inside the block should be indented.


```py
x = 4
if x == 5:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```


> *Notice the colon after the else keyword.*

Every **if** condition block can have only one **else** statement. In
order to make multiple checks, you can chain **if** and **else**
statements.

For example, the following program checks and outputs the **num**
variable's value as text:


```py
num = 3
if num == 1:
    print("One")
else:
    if num == 2:
        print("Two")
    else:
        if num == 3:
            print("Three")
```


> *Indentation determines which **if/else** statements the code blocks
> belong to.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### elif Statements

Multiple **if/else** statements make the code long and not very
readable. The **elif** (short for else if) statement is a shortcut to
use when chaining **if** and **else** statements, making the code
shorter.

The same example from the previous part can be rewritten using **elif**
statements:


```py
num = 3:
if num == 1:
    print("One")
elif num == 2:
    print("Two")
elif num == 3:
    print("Three")
else:
    print("None are true")
```


As you can see in the example above, a series of **if elif** statements
can have a final **else** block, which is called if none of the **if**
or **elif** expressions is **True**. 

> The **elif** statement is
equivalent to an **else/if** statement. It is used to make the code
shorter, more readable, and avoid indentation increase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Boolean Logic

**Boolean logic** is used to make more complicated conditions for **if**
statements that rely on more than one condition. Python's Boolean
operators are **and**, **or**, and **not**. The **and** operator takes
two arguments, and evaluates as **True** if, and only if, both of its
arguments are **True**. Otherwise, it evaluates to **False**.


```py
print( 1 == 1 and 2 == 2)
True

print(1 == 1 and 2 == 3)
False

print( 1 != 1 and 2 > 3)
False

print( 2 < 3 and 3 > 6)
False
```


> Boolean operators can be used in expression as many times as needed.

The **or** operator also takes two arguments. It evaluates to **True**
if either (or both) of its arguments are **True**, and **False** if both
arguments are **False**.


```py
print( 1 == 1 or 2 == 2)
True

print(1 == 1 or 2 == 3)
True

print( 1 != 1 or 2 > 3)
False

print( 2 < 3 or 3 > 6)
True
```


> Besides values, you can also compare variables.

Unlike other operators we've seen so far, **not** only takes one
argument, and inverts it. The result of **not True** is **False**, and
**not False** goes to **True**


```py
print( not 1 == 1)
False

print( not 1 > 7)
True
```


> You can chain multiple conditional statements in an **if** statement
> using the Boolean operators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Operator Precedence

**Operator precedence** is a very important concept in programming. It
is an extension of the mathematical idea of order of operations
(multiplication being performed before addition, etc.) to include other
operators, such as those in Boolean logic.

The below code shows that **==** has a higher precedence than **or**


```py
print(False == False or True)
True

print(False == (False or True))
False

print((False == False) or True)
True
```


> Python's order of operations is the same as that of normal
> mathematics: parentheses first, then exponentiation, then
> multiplication/division, and then addition/subtraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Chaining Multiple Conditions

You can chain multiple conditional statements in an **if** statement
using the Boolean operators.

For example, we can check if the value of a **grade** is between 70 and
100:


```py
grade = 88
if (grade >= 70 and grade <= 100):
    print("Passed!")
```


> You can use multiple **and**, **or**, **not** operators to chain
> multiple conditions together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## None

The **None** object is used to represent the absence of a value. It is
similar to **null** in other programming languages. Like other "empty"
values, such as 0, \[\] and the empty string, it is **False** when
converted to a Boolean variable. When entered at the Python console, it
is displayed as the empty string.


```py
print(None)
```


> Run the code and see how it works!

The **None** object is returned by any function that doesn't explicitly
return anything else.


```py
def some_func():
print("Hi!")
var = some_func()
print(var)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lists

**Lists** are used to store items. A list is created using **square
brackets** with **commas** separating items.


```py
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
```


In the example above the words list contains three string items.

A certain item in the list can be accessed by using its index in square
brackets.

**For example:**


```py
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
print(words[0])
print(words[1])
print(words[2])
```


> The first list item's index is **0**, rather than 1, as might be
> expected.

Sometimes you need to create an empty list and populate it later during
the program. For example, if you are creating a queue management
program, the queue is going to be empty in the beginning and get
populated with people data later.

An empty list is created with an empty pair of square brackets.


```py
empty_list = []
print(empty_list)
```


> In some code samples you might see a comma after the last item in the
> list. It's not mandatory, but perfectly valid.

Typically, a list will contain items of a single item type, but it is
also possible to include several different types. Lists can also be
nested within other lists.


```py
number = 3
things = ["string",  0,  [1,  2, number],  4.56]
print(things[1])
print(things[2])
print(things[2][2])
```


Nested lists can be used to represent 2D grids, such as matrices. **For
example:**


```py
m = [[0,1,2],[4,5,6]]
print(list([1][2])
```


A matrix-like structure can be used in cases where you need to store
data in row-column format. For example, when creating a ticketing
program, the seat numbers can be stored in a matrix, with their
corresponding rows and numbers. \>The code above outputs the 3rd item of
the 2nd row.

Some types, such as **strings**, can be indexed like lists. Indexing
**strings** behaves as though you are indexing a list containing each
character in the string.

**For example:**


```py
string = "Hello world"
print(string[6])
```


Space (" ") is also a symbol and has an index.

> Trying to access a non existing index will lead to an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### List Operations

The item at a certain index in a list can be reassigned. **For
example:**


```py
list = [0,1,2,3,4]
list[2] = 5
print(list)
```


> You can replace the item with an item of a different type.

Lists can be added and multiplied in the same way as strings. **For
example:**


```py
nums = [0,1,2]
print(nums + [3,4,5])
print(nums*3)
```


Lists and strings are similar in many ways - strings can be thought of
as lists of characters that can't be changed.

> For example, the string "Hello" can be thought of as a list, where
> each character is an item in the list. The first item is "H", the
> second item is "e", and so on.

To check if an item is in a list, the **in** operator can be used. It
returns **True** if the item occurs one or more times in the list, and
**False** if it doesn't.


```py
words = ["spam",  "egg",  "spam",  "sausage"]
print("spam"  in words)
print("egg"  in words)
print("tomato"  in words)
```


> The **in** operator is also used to determine whether or not a string
> is a substring of another string.

To check if an item is not in a list, you can use the **not** operator
in one of the following ways:


```py
nums = [1,  2,  3]
print(not  4  in nums)
print(4  not  in nums)
print(not  3  in nums)
print(3  not  in nums)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### List Functions

The **append** method adds an item to the end of an existing list. **For
example:**


```py
nums = [1,2,3]
nums.append[4]
print(nums)
```


> The **dot** before append is there because it is a **method** of the
> list class. Methods will be explained in later.

To get the number of items in a list, you can use the **len** function.


```py
list = [0,1,2,3,4]
print(len(list))
```


Unlike the index of the items, **len** does not start with 0. So, the
list above contains 5 items, meaning **len** will return 5.

> **len** is written before the list it is being called on, without a
> dot.

The **insert** method is similar to **append**, except that it allows
you to insert a new item at any position in the list, as opposed to just
at the end.


```py
words = ["Python",  "fun"]
index = 1
words.insert(index,  "is")
print(words)
```


> Elements, that are after the inserted item, are shifted to the right.

The **index** method finds the first occurrence of a list item and
returns its index. If the item isn't in the list, it raises a
`ValueError`.


```py
letters = ['p',  'q',  'r',  's',  'p',  'u']
print(letters.index('r'))
print(letters.index('p'))
print(letters.index('z'))
```


There are a few more useful functions and methods for lists.

**max**(list): Returns the list item with the maximum value

**min**(list): Returns the list item with minimum value

list.**count**(item): Returns a count of how many times an item occurs
in a list.

list.**remove**(item): Removes an object from a list

list.**reverse**(): Reverses items in a list.

> For example, you can count how many 42s are there in the list using:
> **items.count(42)** where **items** is the name of our list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## while Loops

A **while** loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times. For
example, let's say we need to process multiple user inputs, so that each
time the user inputs something, the same block of code needs to execute.

Below is a **while** loop containing a variable that counts up from 1 to
5, at which point the loop terminates.


```py
i = 1
while i <=5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
print("Finished!")
```


During each loop iteration, the i variable will get incremented by one,
until it reaches 5. So, the loop will execute the print statement 5
times.

> The code in the body of a **while** loop is executed repeatedly. This
> is called **iteration**.

You can use multiple statements in the while loop.

For example, you can use an **if** statement to make decisions. This can
be useful, if you are making a game and need to loop through a number of
player actions and add or remove points of the player.

The code below uses an if/else statement inside a while loop to separate
the even and odd numbers in the range of 1 to 10:


```py
x = 1
while x <= 10:
    if x%2 == 0:
        print(str(x) + "is even")
    else:
        print(str(x) + "is odd")
    x += 1
```


**str(x)** is used to convert the number x to a string, so that it can
be used for concatenation.

> In console, you can stop the program's execution by using the Ctrl-C
> shortcut or by closing the program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### break

To end a **while** loop prematurely, the **break** statement can be
used. For example, we can break an infinite loop if some condition is
met:


```py
i = 0
while  1==1:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
    if i >= 5:
        print("Breaking")
        break
print("Finished")
```


**while True** is a short and easy way to make an infinite loop.

**An example use case of break:** An infinite while loop can be used to
continuously take user input. For example, you are making a calculator
and need to take numbers from the user to add and stop, when the user
enters **"stop"**. In this case, the **break** statement can be used to
end the infinite loop when the user input equals "stop".

> Using the **break** statement outside of a loop causes an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### continue

Another statement that can be used within loops is **continue**. Unlike
**break**, **continue** jumps back to the top of the loop, rather than
stopping it. Basically, the **continue** statement stops the current
iteration and continues with the next one.

**For example:**


```py
i = 0
while i<5:
    i += 1
    if i==3:
        print("Skipping 3")
        continue
    print(i)
```


**An example use case of continue:** An airline ticketing system needs
to calculate the total cost for all tickets purchased. The tickets for
children under the age of 1 are free. We can use a while loop to iterate
through the list of passengers and calculate the total cost of their
tickets. Here, the **continue** statement can be used to skip the
children.

> Using the **continue** statement outside of a loop causes an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## for Loop

The for loop is used to iterate over a given sequence, such as lists or
strings.

The code below outputs each item in the list and adds an exclamation
mark at the end:


```py
words = ['hello', 'world']
for word in words:
    print(word + '!')
```


> In the code above, the word variable represents the corresponding item
> of the list in each iteration of the loop. During the 1st iteration,
> word is equal to "hello", and during the 2nd iteration it's equal to
> "world".

The **for** loop can be used to iterate over strings.

**For example:**


```py
str = "testing for loops"
count = 0
for x in  str:
    if(x == 't'):
        count += 1
print(count)
```


The code above defines a **count** variable, iterates over the string
and calculates the count of 't' letters in it. During each iteration,
the **x** variable represents the current letter of the string. The
**count** variable is incremented each time the letter 't' is found,
thus, at the end of the loop it represents the number of 't' letters in
the string. \>Similar to **while** loops, the **break** and **continue**
statements can be used in **for** loops, to stop the loop or jump to the
next iteration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both, **for** and **while** loops can be used to execute a block of code
for multiple times.

It is common to use the **for** loop when the number of iterations is
fixed. For example, iterating over a fixed list of items in a shopping
list.

The **while** loop is used in cases when the number of iterations is not
known and depends on some calculations and conditions in the code block
of the loop. For example, ending the loop when the user enters a
specific input in a calculator program.

> Both, **for** and **while** loops can be used to achieve the same
> results, however, the **for** loop has cleaner and shorter syntax,
> making it a better choice in most cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Range

The **range()** function returns a sequence of numbers. By default, it
starts from 0, increments by 1 and stops **before the specified
number**.

The code below generates a list containing all of the integers, up to
10.


```py
nums = list(range(10))
print(nums)
```


> In order to output the range as a list, we need to explicitly convert
> it to a list, using the **list()** function.

If **range** is called with one argument, it produces an object with
values from 0 to that argument. If it is called with two arguments, it
produces values from the first to the second. **For example:**


```py
nums = list(range(3,10))
print(numbers)

print(range(20) == range(0,20))
```


> Remember, the second argument is not included in the range, so
> **range(3, 8)** will not include the number 8.

**range** can have a third argument, which determines the interval of
the sequence produced, also called the **step**.


```py
numbers = list(range(5,20,2))
print(numbers)
```


> We can also create list of decreasing numbers, using a negative number
> as the third argument, for example **list(range(20, 5, -2))**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### for Loops

The **for** loop is commonly used to repeat some code a certain number
of times. This is done by combining for loops with **range** objects.


```py
for i in range(5):
    print("hello world!")
```


> You don't need to call **list** on the **range** object when it is
> used in a **for** loop, because it isn't being indexed, so a list
> isn't required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reusing Code

**Code reuse** is a very important part of programming in any language.
Increasing code size makes it harder to maintain. For a large
programming project to be successful, it is essential to abide by the
**Don't Repeat Yourself**, or **DRY**, principle. We've already looked
at one way of doing this: by using loops. In this module, we will
explore two more: functions and modules. \>Bad, repetitive code is said
to abide by the **WET** principle, which stands for **Write Everything
Twice**, or **We Enjoy Typing**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functions

You've already used **functions** previously. Any statement that
consists of a word followed by information in **parentheses** is a
function call. Here are some examples that you've already seen:


```py
print("Hello world")
range(2,20)
str(12)
range(10,20,3)
```


> The words in front of the parentheses are function **names**, and the
> comma-separated values inside the parentheses are function
> **arguments**.

In addition to using pre-defined functions, you can create your own
functions by using the **def** statement. Here is an example of a
function named `my_func`. It takes no arguments, and prints "spam"
three times. It is defined, and then called. The statements in the
function are executed only when the function is called.


```py
def my_func():
    print("spam")
    print("spam")
    print("spam")
my_func()
```


> The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is
> **indented**.

You must define functions before they are called, in the same way that
you must assign variables before using them.


```py
hello()

def hello():
    print('Hello world')
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Arguments

All the function definitions we've looked at so far have been functions
of zero arguments, which are called with empty parentheses. However,
most functions take arguments. The example below defines a function that
takes one argument:


```py
def print_with_exclamation(word):
    print(word + "!")
print_with_exclamation("spam")
print_with_exclamation("eggs")
print_with_exclamation("python")
```


> As you can see, the argument is defined inside the parentheses.

You can also define functions with more than one argument; separate them
with commas.


```py
def print_sum_twice(x, y):
    print(x+y)
    print(x+y)

print_sum_twice(5, 20)
```


Function arguments can be used as variables inside the function
definition. However, they cannot be referenced outside of the function's
definition. This also applies to other variables created inside a
function.


```py
def function(variable):
    variable += 1
    print(variable)
function(7)
print(variable)
```


This code will throw an **error** because the variable is defined inside
the function and can be referenced only there. \>Technically,
**parameters** are the variables in a function definition, and
**arguments** are the values put into parameters when functions are
called.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Returning from Functions

Certain functions, such as `int` or `str` return a value that can
be used later. To do this for your defined functions, you can use the
**return** statement.

**For example:**


```py
def  max(x, y):
    if x >=y:
        return x
    else:
        return y
print(max(4,  7))
z = max(8,  5)
print(z)
```


> The **return** statement cannot be used outside of a function
> definition.

Once you return a value from a function, it immediately stops being
executed. Any code after the **return** statement will never happen.
**For example:**


```py
def add_numbers(x, y):
    total = x + y
    return total
    print("This won't be printed")
print(add_numbers(4,  5))
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Comments

**Comments** are annotations to code used to make it easier to
understand. They don't affect how code is run. In Python, a comment is
created by inserting an **octothorpe** (otherwise known as a number sign
or hash symbol: #). All text after it on that line is ignored. **For
example:**


```py
x = 365
y = 7
# this is a comment
print(x % y)  # find the remainder
# print (x // y)
# another comment
```


> Python doesn't have general purpose multiline comments, as do
> programming languages such as C.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Docstrings

**Docstrings** (documentation strings) serve a similar purpose to
comments, as they are designed to explain code. However, they are more
specific and have a different syntax. They are created by putting a
multiline string containing an explanation of the function below the
**function's first line**.


```py
def shout(word):
"""
Print a word with an
exclamation mark following it.
"""
print(word + "!")
shout("spam")
```


> Unlike conventional comments, **docstrings** are retained throughout
> the runtime of the program. This allows the programmer to inspect
> these comments at run time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although they are created differently from normal variables,
**functions** are just like any other kind of value. They can be
assigned and reassigned to variables, and later referenced by those
names.


```py
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
a = 4
b = 7
operation = multiply
print(operation(a, b))
```


> The example above assigned the function **multiply** to a variable
> **operation**. Now, the name **operation** can also be used to call
> the function.

Functions can also be used as **arguments** of other functions.


```py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
def do_twice(func, x, y):
return func(func(x, y), func(x, y))
a = 5
b = 10
print(do_twice(add, a, b))
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Modules

**Modules** are pieces of code that other people have written to fulfill
common tasks, such as generating random numbers, performing mathematical
operations, etc.

The basic way to use a module is to add **import module_name** at the
top of your code, and then using **module_name.var** to access functions
and values with the name **var** in the module. For example, the
following example uses the **random** module to generate random numbers:


```py
import random
for i in  range(5):
    value = random.randint(1,  6)
    print(value)
```


> The code uses the **randint** function defined in the **random**
> module to print 5 random numbers in the range 1 to 6.

There is another kind of **import** that can be used if you only need
certain functions from a module. These take the form **from module_name
import var**, and then **var** can be used as if it were defined
normally in your code. For example, to import only the **pi** constant
from the **math** module:


```py
from math import pi
    print(pi)
```


Use a comma separated list to import multiple objects. For example:

from math import pi, sqrt

> \* imports all objects from a module. For example: **from math
> import** \*. This is generally discouraged, as it confuses variables
> in your code with variables in the external module.

Trying to import a module that isn't available causes an ImportError.


```py
import some_module
```


You can import a module or object under a different name using the
**as** keyword. This is mainly used when a module or object has a long
or confusing name. **For example:**


```py
from math import sqrt as square_root
print(sqruare_root(100))
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The standard library

There are three main types of modules in Python, those you write
yourself, those you install from external sources, and those that are
pre-installed with Python. The last type is called the **standard
library**, and contains many useful modules. Some of the standard
library's useful modules include `string`, `re`, `datetime`, `math`, `random`, `os`, `multiprocessing`, `subprocess`, `socket`, `email`, `json`, `doctest`, `unittest`, `pdb`, `argparse` and `sys`.

Tasks that can be done by the standard library include string parsing,
data serialization, testing, debugging and manipulating dates, emails,
command line arguments, and much more!

> Python's extensive standard library is one of its main strengths as a
> language.

Some of the modules in the standard library are written in Python, and
some are written in C. Most are available on all platforms, but some are
Windows or Unix specific.

> We won't cover all of the modules in the standard library; there are
> simply too many. The complete documentation for the standard library
> is available online at www.python.org.

Many third-party Python modules are stored on the **Python Package Index
(PyPI)**. The best way to install these is using a program called
**pip**. This comes installed by default with modern distributions of
Python. If you don't have it, it is easy to install online. Once you
have it, installing libraries from PyPI is easy. Look up the name of the
library you want to install, go to the command line (for Windows it will
be the Command Prompt), and enter **pip install library_name**. Once
you've done this, import the library and use it in your code.

Using **pip** is the standard way of installing libraries on most
operating systems, but some libraries have prebuilt binaries for
Windows. These are normal executable files that let you install
libraries with a GUI the same way you would install other programs.

> It's important to enter **pip** commands at the command line, not the
> Python interpreter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exceptions

You have already seen **exceptions** in previous code. They occur when
something goes wrong, due to incorrect code or input. When an exception
occurs, the program immediately stops. The following code produces the
`ZeroDivisionError` exception by trying to divide 7 by 0.


```py
print(7//0)
```


Different exceptions are raised for different reasons. Common
exceptions: `ImportError`: an import fails; `IndexError`: a list is
indexed with an out-of-range number; `NameError`: an unknown variable
is used; `SyntaxError`: the code can't be parsed properly;
`TypeError`: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;
`ValueError`: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but
with an inappropriate value.

> Python has several other built-in exceptions, such as
> `ZeroDivisionError` and `OSError`. Third-party libraries also often define
> their own exceptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exception Handling

To handle exceptions, and to call code when an exception occurs, you can
use a **try/except** statement. The **try** block contains code that
might throw an exception. If that exception occurs, the code in the
**try** block stops being executed, and the code in the **except** block
is run. If no error occurs, the code in the **except** block doesn't
run. **For example:**


```py
try:
    num1 = 7
    num2 = 0
    print  (num1 / num2)
    print("Done calculation")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("An error occurred")
    print("due to zero division")
```


> In the code above, the except statement defines the type of exception
> to handle (in our case, the `ZeroDivisionError`.

A **try** statement can have multiple different **except** blocks to
handle different exceptions. Multiple exceptions can also be put into a
single **except** block using parentheses, to have the **except** block
handle all of them.


```py
try:
    variable = 10
    print(variable + "hello")
    print(variable / 2)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Divided by zero")
except  (ValueError, TypeError):
    print("Error occurred")
```


An **except** statement without any exception specified will catch all
errors. These should be used sparingly, as they can catch unexpected
errors and hide programming mistakes. **For example:**


```py
try:
    word ="spam"
    print(word/0)
except:
    print("An error occured")
```


> Exception handling is particularly useful when dealing with user
> input.

To ensure some code runs no matter what errors occur, you can use a
**finally** statement. The **finally** statement is placed at the bottom
of a **try/except** statement. Code within a **finally** statement
always runs after execution of the code in the **try**, and possibly in
the **except**, blocks.


```py
try:
    print("Hello")
    print(1 / 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Divided by zero")
finally:
    print("This code will run no matter what")
```


> Run the code and see how it works!

Code in a **finally** statement even runs if an uncaught exception
occurs in one of the preceding blocks.


```py
try:
    print(1)
    print(10 / 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print(unknown_var)
finally:
    print("This is executed last")
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Raising exceptions

You can raise exceptions by using the **raise** statement.


```py
print(1)
raise ValueError
print(2)
```


> You need to specify the **type** of the exception raised.

Exceptions can be raised with arguments that give detail about them.
**For example:**


```py
name = "123"
raise NameError("Invalid Name: ")
```


In **except** blocks, the **raise** statement can be used without
arguments to re-raise whatever exception occurred. **For example:**


```py
try:
    num = 5 / 0
except:
    print("An error occurred")
    raise
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assertions

An **assertion** is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when
you have finished testing the program. An expression is tested, and if
the result comes up false, an exception is raised. Assertions are
carried out through use of the **assert** statement.


```py
print(1)
assert  2 + 2 == 4
print(2)
assert  1 + 1 == 3
print(3)
```


> Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check
> for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output.

The **assert** can take a second argument that is passed to the
`AssertionError` raised if the assertion fails.


```py
temp = -10
assert (temp >=0), "Colder than absolute zero!"
```


> AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other
> exception using the **try-except** statement, but if not handled, this
> type of exception will terminate the program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Files

You can use Python to read and write the contents of **files**. Text
files are the easiest to manipulate. Before a file can be edited, it
must be opened, using the **open** function.


```py
myfile = open("filename.txt")
```


> The argument of the **open** function is the **path** to the file. If
> the file is in the current working directory of the program, you can
> specify only its name.

You can specify the **mode** used to open a file by applying a second
argument to the **open** function. Sending "r" means open in read mode,
which is the default. Sending "w" means write mode, for rewriting the
contents of a file. Sending "a" means append mode, for adding new
content to the end of the file.

Adding "b" to a mode opens it in **binary** mode, which is used for
non-text files (such as image and sound files). **For example:**


```py
# write mode
open("filename.txt", "w")

# read mode
open("filename.txt", "r")
open("filename.txt")

# binary write mode
open("filename.txt", "wb")
```


> You can use the + sign with each of the modes above to give them extra
> access to files. For example, r+ opens the file for both reading and
> writing.

Once a file has been opened and used, you should close it. This is done
with the **close** method of the file object.


```py
file = open("filename.txt", "w")
# do stuff to the file
file.close()
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contents of a file that has been opened in text mode can be read
using the **read** method.


```py
file = open("filename.txt", "r")
cont = file.read()
print(cont)
file.close()
```


> This will print all of the contents of the file "filename.txt".

To read only a certain amount of a file, you can provide a number as an
argument to the **read** function. This determines the number of
**bytes** that should be read. You can make more calls to **read** on
the same file object to read more of the file byte by byte. With no
argument, **read** returns the rest of the file.


```py
file = open("filename.txt", "r")
print(file.read(16))
print(file.read(4))
print(file.read(4))
print(file.read())
file.close()
```


> Just like passing no arguments, negative values will return the entire
> contents.

After all contents in a file have been read, any attempts to read
further from that file will return an empty string, because you are
trying to read from the end of the file.


```py
file = open("filename.txt", "r")
file.read()
print("Re-reading")
print(file.read())
print("Finished")
file.close()
```


**Result:**


```py
>>>
Re-reading

Finished
>>>
```


To retrieve each line in a file, you can use the **readlines** method to
return a list in which each element is a line in the file. **For
example:**

file = open("filename.txt", "r") print(file.readlines()) file.close()

**Result:**


```py
>>>
['Line 1 text \n', 'Line 2 text \n', 'Line 3 text']
>>>
```


You can also use a **for** loop to iterate through the lines in the
file:


```py
file = open("filename.txt", "r")

for line in file:
print(line)

file.close()
```


**Result:**


```py
>>>
Line 1 text

Line 2 text

Line 3 text
>>>
```


> In the output, the lines are separated by blank lines, as the
> **print** function automatically adds a new line at the end of its
> output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To write to files you use the **write** method, which writes a string to
the file. **For example:**


```py
file = open("newfile.txt",  "w")
file.write("This has been written to a file")
file.close()
file = open("newfile.txt",  "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()
```


> The "w" mode will create a file, if it does not already exist.

When a file is opened in write mode, the file's existing content is
deleted.


```py
file = open("newfile.txt",  "w")
file.write("Some new text")
file.close()
file = open("newfile.txt",  "r")
print("Reading new contents")
print(file.read())
print("Finished")
file.close()
```


> As you can see, the content of the file has been overwritten.

The **write** method returns the number of **bytes** written to a file,
if successful.


```py
msg = "Hello world!"
file = open("newfile.txt",  "w")
amount_written = file.write(msg)
print(amount_written)
file.close()
```


> To write something other than a string, it needs to be converted to a
> string first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is good practice to avoid wasting resources by making sure that files
are always closed after they have been used. One way of doing this is to
use **try** and **finally**


```py
try:
    f = open("filename.txt")
    print(f.read())
finally:
    f.close()
```


> This ensures that the file is always closed, even if an error occurs.

An alternative way of doing this is using **with** statements. This
creates a temporary variable (often called **f**), which is only
accessible in the indented block of the **with** statement.


```py
with open("filename.txt")  as f:
print(f.read())
```


> The file is automatically closed at the end of the **with** statement,
> even if exceptions occur within it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Dictionaries

**Dictionaries** are data structures used to map arbitrary keys to
values. Lists can be thought of as dictionaries with integer keys within
a certain range. Dictionaries can be indexed in the same way as lists,
using **square brackets** containing keys. **Example:**


```py
ages = {"Dave":  24,  "Mary":  42,  "John":  58}
print(ages["Dave"])
print(ages["Mary"])
```


> Each element in a dictionary is represented by a **key:value** pair.

Trying to index a key that isn't part of the dictionary returns a
**KeyError**. **Example:**


```py
primary = {
"red":  [255,  0,  0],
"green":  [0,  255,  0],
"blue":  [0,  0,  255],
}
print(primary["red"])
print(primary["yellow"])
```


As you can see, a dictionary can store any types of data as values. \>An
empty dictionary is defined as **{}**.

Only **immutable** objects can be used as keys to dictionaries.
**Immutable** objects are those that can't be changed. So far, the only
mutable objects you've come across are **lists** and **dictionaries**.
Trying to use a mutable object as a dictionary key causes a
**TypeError**.


```py
bad_dict = {

[1,  2,  3]:  "one two three",

}
```


> Run the code and see how it works!

Just like lists, dictionary keys can be assigned to different values.
However, unlike lists, a new dictionary key can also be assigned a
value, not just ones that already exist.


```py
squares = {1:  1,  2:  4,  3:  "error",  4:  16,}
squares[8] = 64
squares[3] = 9
print(squares)
```


To determine whether a key is in a dictionary, you can use **in** and
**not in**, just as you can for a list. **Example:**


```py
nums = {
1:  "one",
2:  "two",
3:  "three",
}
print(1  in nums)
print("three"  in nums)
print(4  not  in nums)
```


A useful dictionary method is **get**. It does the same thing as
indexing, but if the key is not found in the dictionary it returns
another specified value instead ('None', by default). **Example:**


```py
pairs = {1:  "apple",
"orange":  [2,  3,  4],
True:  False,
None:  "True",
}

print(pairs.get("orange"))
print(pairs.get(7))
print(pairs.get(12345,  "not in dictionary"))
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tuples

**Tuples** are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable
(they cannot be changed). Also, they are created using **parentheses**,
rather than square brackets. **Example:**


```py
words = ("spam", "eggs", "sausages",)
```


You can access the values in the tuple with their index, just as you did
with lists:


```py
print(words[0])
```


Trying to reassign a value causes a TypeError.


```py
words[1] = "cheese"
```


> You can access the values in the tuple with their index, just as you
> did with lists.

Tuples can be created without the parentheses, by just separating the
values with commas. **Example:**


```py
my_tuple = "one", "two", "three"
print(my_tuple[0])
```


An empty tuple is created using an empty parenthesis pair.


```py
tpl = ()
```


> Tuples are faster than lists, but they cannot be changed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## List Slices

**List slices** provide a more advanced way of retrieving values from a
list. Basic list slicing involves indexing a list with **two
colon-separated integers**. This returns a new list containing all the
values in the old list between the indices. **Example:**


```py
squares = [0,  1,  4,  9,  16,  25,  36,  49,  64,  81]
print(squares[2:6])
print(squares[3:8])
print(squares[0:1])
```


> Like the arguments to **range**, the first index provided in a slice
> is included in the result, but the second isn't.

If the first number in a slice is omitted, it is taken to be the start
of the list. If the second number is omitted, it is taken to be the end.
**Example:**


```py
squares = [0,  1,  4,  9,  16,  25,  36,  49,  64,  81]
print(squares[:7])
print(squares[7:])
```


> Slicing can also be done on tuples.

List slices can also have a third number, representing the step, to
include only alternate values in the slice.


```py
squares = [0,  1,  4,  9,  16,  25,  36,  49,  64,  81]
print(squares[::2])
print(squares[2:8:3])
```


> \[2:8:3\] will include elements starting from the 2nd index up to the
> 8th with a step of 3.

**Negative** values can be used in list slicing (and normal list
indexing). When negative values are used for the first and second values
in a slice (or a normal index), they count from the end of the list.


```py
squares = [0,  1,  4,  9,  16,  25,  36,  49,  64,  81]
print(squares[1::-1])
```


> If a negative value is used for the step, the slice is done backwards.
> Using **\[::-1\]** as a slice is a common and idiomatic way to reverse
> a list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## List Comprehensions

**List comprehensions** are a useful way of quickly creating lists whose
contents obey a simple rule. For example, we can do the following:


```py
# a list comprehension
cubes = [i**3  for i in  range(5)]
print(cubes)
```


> List comprehensions are inspired by set-builder notation in
> mathematics.

A list comprehension can also contain an **if** statement to enforce a
condition on values in the list. **Example:**


```py
evens=[i**2  for i in  range(10)  if i**2 % 2 == 0]
print(evens)
```


Trying to create a list in a very extensive range will result in a
**MemoryError**. This code shows an example where the list comprehension
runs out of memory.


```py
even = [2*i for i in  range(10**100)]
```


> This issue is solved by **generators**, which are covered later.

## String Formatting

So far, to combine strings and non-strings, you've converted the
non-strings to strings and added them. String formatting provides a more
powerful way to embed non-strings within strings. String formatting uses
a string's **format** method to substitute a number of arguments in the
string. **Example:**


```py
# string formatting
nums = [4,  5,  6]
msg = "Numbers: {0} {1} {2}". format(nums[0], nums[1], nums[2])
print(msg)
```


> Each argument of the format function is placed in the string at the
> corresponding position, which is determined using the curly braces {
> }.

String formatting can also be done with named arguments. **Example:**


```py
a= "{x}, {y}".format(x = 5, y = 12)
print(a)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## String Functions

Python contains many useful built-in functions and methods to accomplish
common tasks. **join** - joins a list of strings with another string as
a separator. **replace** - replaces one substring in a string with
another. **startswith** and **endswith -** determine if there is a
substring at the start and end of a string, respectively. To change the
case of a string, you can use **lower** and **upper**. The method
**split** is the opposite of **join** turning a string with a certain
separator into a list. **Some examples:**


```py
print(", ".join(["spam",  "eggs",  "ham"]))
#prints "spam, eggs, ham"

print("Hello ME".replace("ME",  "world"))
#prints "Hello world"

print("This is a sentence.".startswith("This"))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".endswith("sentence."))
# prints "True"

print("This is a sentence.".upper())
# prints "THIS IS A SENTENCE."

print("AN ALL CAPS SENTENCE".lower())
#prints "an all caps sentence"

print("spam, eggs, ham".split(", "))
#prints "['spam', 'eggs', 'ham']"
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Numeric Functions

To find the maximum or minimum of some numbers or a list, you can use
**max** or **min**. To find the distance of a number from zero (its
absolute value), use **abs**. To round a number to a certain number of
decimal places, use **round**. To find the total of a list, use **sum**.
**Some examples:**


```py
print(min(1,  2,  3,  4,  0,  2,  1))
print(max([1,  4,  9,  2,  5,  6,  8]))
print(abs(-99))
print(abs(42))
print(sum([1,  2,  3,  4,  5]))
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## List Functions

Often used in conditional statements, **all** and **any** take a list as
an argument, and return **True** if all or any (respectively) of their
arguments evaluate to **True** (and **False** otherwise). The function
**enumerate** can be used to iterate through the values and indices of a
list simultaneously. **Example:**


```py
nums = [55,  44,  33,  22,  11]
if  all([i > 5  for i in nums]):
    print("All larger than 5")

if  any([i % 2 == 0  for i in nums]):
    print("At least one is even")

for v in  enumerate(nums):
    print(v)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Functional Programming

**Functional programming** is a style of programming that (as the name
suggests) is based around functions. A key part of functional
programming is **higher-order functions**. We have seen this idea
briefly in the previous lesson on functions as objects. Higher-order
functions take other functions as arguments, or return them as results.
**Example:**


```py
def apply_twice(func, arg):
    return func(func(arg))

def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

print(apply_twice(add_five,  10))
```


> The function **apply_twice** takes another function as its argument,
> and calls it twice inside its body.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pure Functions

Functional programming seeks to use **pure functions**. Pure functions
have no side effects, and return a value that depends **only** on their
arguments. This is how functions in math work: for example, The cos(x)
will, for the same value of x, always return the same result. Below are
examples of pure and impure functions. **Pure function:**


```py
def pure_function(x, y):
    temp = x + 2*y
    return temp / (2*x + y)
```


**Impure function:**


```py
some_list = []
def impure(arg):
    some_list.append(arg)
```


> The function above is not pure, because it changed the state of
> **some_list**.

Using pure functions has both advantages and disadvantages. Pure
functions are: - easier to reason about and test. - more efficient. Once
the function has been evaluated for an input, the result can be stored
and referred to the next time the function of that input is needed,
reducing the number of times the function is called. This is called
**memoization**. - easier to run in parallel.

> The main disadvantage of using only pure functions is that they
> majorly complicate the otherwise simple task of I/O, since this
> appears to inherently require side effects. They can also be more
> difficult to write in some situations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Lambdas

Creating a function normally (using **def**) assigns it to a variable
automatically. This is different from the creation of other objects -
such as strings and integers - which can be created on the fly, without
assigning them to a variable. The same is possible with functions,
provided that they are created using **lambda** syntax. Functions
created this way are known as **anonymous**. This approach is most
commonly used when passing a simple function as an argument to another
function. The syntax is shown in the next example and consists of the
**lambda** keyword followed by a list of arguments, a colon, and the
expression to evaluate and return.


```py
def my_func(f, arg):
return f(arg)

my_func(lambda x: 2*x*x, 5)
```


> Lambda functions get their name from **lambda calculus**, which is a
> model of computation invented by Alonzo Church.

Lambda functions aren't as powerful as named functions. They can only do
things that require a single expression - usually equivalent to a single
line of code. **Example:**


```py
#named function
def polynomial(x):
return x**2 + 5*x + 4
print(polynomial(-4))

#lambda
print((lambda x: x**2 + 5*x + 4)  (-4))
```


> In the code above, we created an anonymous function on the fly and
> called it with an argument.

Lambda functions can be assigned to variables, and used like normal
functions. **Example:**


```py
double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(7))
```


> However, there is rarely a good reason to do this - it is usually
> better to define a function with **def** instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### map

The function **map** takes a function and an iterable as arguments, and
returns a new iterable with the function applied to each argument.
**Example:**


```py
def add_five(x):
return x + 5

nums = [11,  22,  33,  44,  55]
result = list(map(add_five, nums))
print(result)
```


We could have achieved the same result more easily by using **lambda**
syntax.


```py
nums = [11,  22,  33,  44,  55]

result = list(map(lambda x: x+5, nums))
print(result)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### filter

The function **filter** filters an iterable by removing items that don't
match a predicate (a function that returns a Boolean). **Example:**


```py
nums = [11,  22,  33,  44,  55]
res = list(filter(lambda x: x%2==0, nums))
print(res)
```


> Like **map**, the result has to be explicitly converted to a list if
> you want to print it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Generators

**Generators** are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples. Unlike
lists, they don't allow indexing with arbitrary indices, but they can
still be iterated through with **for** loops. They can be created using
functions and the **yield** statement. **Example:**


```py
def countdown():
    i=5
    while i > 0:
        yield i
        i -= 1



for i in countdown():
    print(i)
```


> The **yield** statement is used to define a generator, replacing the
> return of a function to provide a result to its caller without
> destroying local variables.

Due to the fact that they **yield** one item at a time, generators don't
have the memory restrictions of lists. In fact, they can be
**infinite!**


```py
def infinite_sevens():
    while True:
        yield 7

for i in infinite_sevens():
    print(i)
```


**Result:**


```py
>>>
7
7
7
7
7
7
7
...
```


> In short, **generators** allow you to declare a function that behaves
> like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a **for** loop.

Finite generators can be converted into lists by passing them as
arguments to the **list** function.


```py
def numbers(x):
    for i in  range(x):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

print(list(numbers(11)))
```


> Using **generators** results in improved performance, which is the
> result of the lazy (on demand) generation of values, which translates
> to lower memory usage. Furthermore, we do not need to wait until all
> the elements have been generated before we start to use them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Decorators

**Decorators** provide a way to modify functions using other functions.
This is ideal when you need to extend the functionality of functions
that you don't want to modify. **Example:**


```py
def decor(func):
    def wrap():
        print("============")
        func()
        print("============")
    return wrap

def print_text():
print("Hello world!")

decorated = decor(print_text)
decorated()
```


We defined a function named **decor** that has a single parameter
**func**. Inside **decor**, we defined a nested function named **wrap**.
The **wrap** function will print a string, then call **func()**, and
print another string. The **decor** function returns the **wrap**
function as its result. We could say that the variable **decorated** is
a decorated version of **print_text** - it's **print_text** plus
something. In fact, if we wrote a useful decorator we might want to
replace **print_text** with the decorated version altogether so we
always got our "plus something" version of **print_text**. This is done
by re-assigning the variable that contains our function:


```py
def decor(func):
    def wrap():
        print("============")
        func()
        print("============")
    return wrap

def print_text():
print("Hello world!")

print_text = decor(print_text)
print_text()
```


> Now **print_text** corresponds to our decorated version.

This pattern can be used at any time, to wrap any function. Python
provides support to wrap a function in a decorator by pre-pending the
function definition with a decorator name and the @ symbol. If we are
defining a function we can "decorate" it with the @ symbol like:


```py
@decor
def print_text():
    print("Hello world!")

print_text();
```


This will have the same result as the above code.

> A single function can have multiple decorators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recursion

**Recursion** is a very important concept in functional programming. The
fundamental part of recursion is self-reference - functions calling
themselves. It is used to solve problems that can be broken up into
easier sub-problems of the same type.

A classic example of a function that is implemented recursively is the
**factorial** function, which finds the product of all positive integers
below a specified number. For example, 5! (5 factorial) is 5 \* 4 \* 3
\* 2 \* 1 (120). To implement this recursively, notice that 5! = 5 \*
4!, 4! = 4 \* 3!, 3! = 3 \* 2!, and so on. Generally, n! = n \* (n-1)!.
Furthermore, 1! = 1. This is known as the **base case**, as it can be
calculated without performing any more factorials. Below is a recursive
implementation of the factorial function.


```py
def factorial(x):
    if x == 1:
        return  1
    else:
        return x * factorial(x-1)

print(factorial(5))
```


> The **base case** acts as the exit condition of the recursion.

Recursive functions can be infinite, just like infinite **while** loops.
These often occur when you forget to implement the base case. Below is
an incorrect version of the factorial function. It has no base case, so
it runs until the interpreter runs out of memory and crashes.


```py
def factorial(x):
    return x * factorial(x-1)

print(factorial(5))
```


Recursion can also be indirect. One function can call a second, which
calls the first, which calls the second, and so on. This can occur with
any number of functions. **Example:**


```py
def is_even(x):
    if x == 0:
        return  True
    else:
        return is_odd(x-1)

def is_odd(x):
    return  not is_even(x)

print(is_odd(17))
print(is_even(23))
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sets

**Sets** are data structures, similar to lists or dictionaries. They are
created using curly braces, or the **set** function. They share some
functionality with lists, such as the use of **in** to check whether
they contain a particular item.


```py
num_set = {1,  2,  3,  4,  5}
word_set = set(["spam",  "eggs",  "sausage"])

print(3  in num_set)
print("spam"  not  in word_set)
```


> To create an empty set, you must use **set()**, as **{}** creates an
> empty dictionary.

Sets differ from lists in several ways, but share several list
operations such as **len**. They are unordered, which means that they
can't be indexed. They **cannot** contain duplicate elements. Due to the
way they're stored, it's **faster** to check whether an item is part of
a set, rather than part of a list. Instead of using **append** to add to
a set, use **add**. The method **remove** removes a specific element
from a set; **pop** removes an arbitrary element.


```py
nums = {1,  2,  1,  3,  1,  4,  5,  6}
print(nums)
nums.add(-7)
nums.remove(3)
print(nums)
```


> Basic uses of **sets** include membership testing and the elimination
> of duplicate entries.

Sets can be combined using mathematical operations. The **union**
operator **\|** combines two sets to form a new one containing items in
either. The **intersection** operator **&** gets items only in both. The
**difference** operator **-** gets items in the first set but not in the
second. The **symmetric difference** operator **\^** gets items in
either set, but not both.


```py
first = {1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6}
second = {4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9}

print(first | second)
print(first & second)
print(first - second)
print(second - first)
print(first ^ second)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Structures

As we have seen in the previous lessons, Python supports the following
data structures: **lists**, **dictionaries**, **tuples**, **sets**.

**When to use a dictionary:** - When you need a logical association
between a **key:value** pair. - When you need fast lookup for your data,
based on a custom key. - When your data is being constantly modified.
Remember, dictionaries are mutable.

**When to use the other types:** - Use **lists** if you have a
collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists
when you need a simple, iterable collection that is modified
frequently. - Use a **set** if you need uniqueness for the elements. -
Use **tuples** when your data cannot change.

> Many times, a **tuple** is used in combination with a **dictionary**,
> for example, a **tuple** might represent a key, because it's
> immutable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### itertools

The module **itertools** is a standard library that contains several
functions that are useful in functional programming. One type of
function it produces is infinite iterators. The function **count**
counts up infinitely from a value. The function **cycle** infinitely
iterates through an iterable (for instance a list or string). The
function **repeat** repeats an object, either infinitely or a specific
number of times. **Example:**


```py
from itertools import count
for i in count(3):
    print(i)
    if i >=11:
        break
```


There are many functions in **itertools** that operate on iterables, in
a similar way to **map** and **filter**. Some examples: **takewhile -**
takes items from an iterable while a predicate function remains true;
**chain -** combines several iterables into one long one; **accumulate
-** returns a running total of values in an iterable.


```py
from itertools import accumulate, takewhile
nums = list(accumulate(range(8)))
print(nums)
print(list(takewhile(lambda x: x<= 6, nums)))
```


There are also several combinatoric functions in **itertool**, such as
**product** and **permutation**. These are used when you want to
accomplish a task with all possible combinations of some items.
**Example:**


```py
from itertools import product, permutations
letters = ("A",  "B")
print(list(product(letters,  range(2))))
print(list(permutations(letters)))
```
